## Experiments Overview

### 1. Employee Management System
This experiment is focused on creating an employee management system using Node.js and Express. The system stores employee information such as name, address, and salary in a JSON file. The following features are implemented:
- Adding a new employee
- Updating employee details
- Deleting an employee
- Retrieving employee information

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- Express
- JSON

### 2. File System Module (JSON)
In this experiment, data is stored in a JSON file using Node.js's `fs` module. The following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed on the stored data:
- Adding new data
- Reading data from the JSON file
- Updating existing data
- Deleting data

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- File System (`fs` module)
- JSON

### 3. File System Module (Text)
Similar to the previous experiment, this one focuses on storing data in a text file and performing CRUD operations using the `fs` module. The operations are similar but involve handling plain text data instead of JSON.

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- File System (`fs` module)
- Text Files

### 4. Login/Signup Integration
This project integrates a login/signup system with the Employee Management System (Experiment 1). It involves creating user authentication functionality where users can sign up and log in to access the employee management features.

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- Express
- JSON
- User Authentication
